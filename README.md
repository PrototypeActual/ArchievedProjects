# AutoSeedDMS-CentOS7
Bash script to deploy SeedDMS 5.1.9 on a fresh CentOS 7 machine with very little setting up.
There are messages displayed during the installation of this script to keep you aware of certain things as well as comments in the script to explain what the commands in the script do.

What you will still need
1. Create a database server (installed on the same machine you run this script or on a seperate machine)
2. Create a database table for SeedDMS to use
3. Create a database user for SeedDMS to use for accessing your database/database table
4. Grant that database user access to the database table
