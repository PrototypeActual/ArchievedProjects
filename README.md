# AutoSeedDMS-Centos7
Bash script to deploy SeedDMS 5.1.9 on CentOS7 with very little after setup.
There are messages displayed during the installation of this script to keep you aware of certain things.

What it still needs
1. Database, with table and users still needs to be setup (on the same system this installs on or another seperate one).
2. SELinux needs to be disabled or have an exception to allow SeedDMS to run.
